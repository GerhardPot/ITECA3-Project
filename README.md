# ITECA3-Project
This repository is where I will keep and update my project required for a college module (ITECA3-12).

# What is the project about?
The overview of the project is e-commerce. Our objective is to create an e-commerce website.

E-commerce is the trade of goods or services online. I chose to do both, and a little extra.

I chose to go with a PC repair shop, aptly named PC REPAIR SHOP. They also handle e-waste.

# What will I include in my project?
My project will consist of 2 parts:
1. The customers
2. The business

# Backstory
My website needs to do the following:
- Manage employees (not required)
- Manage stock (required)
- Manage customers (required)

Customers can use the service by logging a ticket to get a device repaired and see updates in real time as the technician updates their ticket (service).
Customers can sell e-waste products to the business, which they will receive incentives for (goods).
Employees can manage stock (management).
Customers and employees can track deliveries and pickups of devices (service).

# Some things to note
This project will be done with MVC and Entity Framework. This super simplifies the process of creating the website, as well as bulk handling the most and allowing me to focus on the important aspect of my entire project: SQL.

# What my project actually is
My project is a ticketing system with built-in stock management and employee management using mainly SQL.
